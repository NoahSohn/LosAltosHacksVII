ungulates are members of the diverse clade ungulata which primarily consists of large mammals with hooves. living ungulates are divided into two orders: the odd-toed ungulates (perissodactyla) including horses, rhinoceroses, and tapirs; and even-toed ungulates (artiodactyla) such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, sheep, deer, and hippopotamuses. cetaceans such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises are also classified as even-toed ungulates, although they do not have hooves. most terrestrial ungulates use the hoofed tips of their toes to support their body weight while standing or moving. two other orders of ungulates, notoungulata, and litopterna, native to south america, became extinct at the end of the pleistocene, around 12,000 years ago.

        the term means, roughly, "being hoofed" or "hoofed animal". as a descriptive term, "ungulate" normally excludes cetaceans as they do not possess most of the typical morphological characteristics of other ungulates, but recent discoveries indicate that they were also descended from early artiodactyls.[4] ungulates are typically herbivorous and many employ specialized gut bacteria to allow them to digest cellulose. some modern species, such as pigs, are omnivorous, while some prehistoric species, such as mesonychians, were carnivorous.

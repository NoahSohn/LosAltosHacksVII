sea urchins (/ˈɜːrtʃɪnz/) are spiny, globular echinoderms in the class echinoidea. about 950 species of sea urchin live on the seabed of every ocean and inhabit every depth zone from the intertidal seashore down to 5,000 meters (16,000 ft; 2,700 fathoms). the spherical, hard shells (tests) of sea urchins are round and covered in spines. most urchin spines range in length from 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in), with outliers such as the black sea urchin possessing spines as long as 30 cm (12 in). sea urchins move slowly, crawling with tube feet, and also propel themselves with their spines. although algae are the primary diet, sea urchins also eat slow-moving (sessile) animals. predators that eat sea urchins include a wide variety of fish, starfish, crabs, marine mammals, and humans.    <links>
